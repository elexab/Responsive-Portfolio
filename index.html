            Hello, my name is Elexa Evans and I am currently enrolled in
            the SMU Boot Camp to become a Full Stack Developer.  Every since 
            I was younger, I always enjoyed working with computers.  As I got older, that 
            passion drew me to want to become a Developer and build websites and apps.  My
            original major in college was Computer Science at The University of North Texas. 
            Two years into my degree plan, I soon realized that I was not grasping the 
            programming concepts needed for me to successfully become a Developer.  This led me 
            to decided to change my major.
        </p>
        <p class="secondP">
            I decided to change my major to Information Science and Applied Technolody with a 
            concentration in Project and Knowledge Management in hopes to become an IT Project Manager.
            After graduating in December 2018, I found myself still searching for employment in the Project
            Management field six months later.  I was then presented with this opportunity to attend this 
            Boot Camp and have the potential to get employed upon successfully completed it.  I am extremely
            grateful that I was provided this opportunity and hope that I get hired by Tek Systems.
